## Pre-reqs
- This project was created using Node.js v19.6
- Ideally, you should use the project in a Unix (Linux) environment. If you are on Windows, it is recommended that you use the [Windows Subsystem Linux](https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/how-to-install-wsl2-on-wind) as the classes show Linux commands that may not exist on Windows.

## Important
Every day at 6 PM (18hrs), I am uploading the code of the current day's classes into the 'classes' folder. If you are starting the project, delete the 'classes' folder to start from scratch!

## Running
Run npm ci in the folder containing the package.json file to restore the packages.
Run npm start and then go to your browser at http://localhost:3000 to view the above page.
